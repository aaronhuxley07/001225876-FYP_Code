## Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions using machine learning models and interpret their predictions using Explainable AI (SHAP). The solution includes a training pipeline, model optimisation, SHAP-based explanation, and a Streamlit web interface for testing and user interaction.

## Notebooks Summary

### `machine_learning_pipeline.ipynb`
- Loads Elliptic dataset
- Preprocesses data (scaling, splitting)
- Trains and fine-tunes ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Evaluates and compares models
- Saves the best model (`model.pkl`) and SHAP explainer (`explainer.pkl`)

### `sample_dataset_creator.ipynb`
- Generates smaller datasets with real transaction data for quick testing in the Streamlit app

> PDF versions of both notebooks are provided in `/pdfs_of_notebooks/` for easy viewing without running lengthy training processes.

## Streamlit Web App

### `crypto_fraud_detection.py`
- Loads the trained `model.pkl` and `explainer.pkl`
- Lets users upload sample CSV datasets
- Predicts if a transaction is licit or illicit
- Allows for export of predictions
- Visualises explanations using SHAP
- Allows for export of Explanations
- Visualises SHAP Heatmap (Can be toggled on/off)
- Allows for export of SHAP Heatmap

Please download the following files from the Kaggle page and place them in the `datasets/` folder of the notebook before running:

- `elliptic_txs_classes.csv`
- `elliptic_txs_features.csv`
  
### Run application locally

Clone repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaronhuxley07/001225876-FYP_Code.git
cd 001225876-FYP_Code
```

Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Launch Streamlit app
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
streamlit run application/main.py
```

Test Streamlit app

Drag and drop a sample dataset included in this repository (e.g. titled 'sample_deployment_data.csv') under the `datasets/` folder.

Edit: Installing Python 3.11 gets rid of any errors when running the application throguh terminal
